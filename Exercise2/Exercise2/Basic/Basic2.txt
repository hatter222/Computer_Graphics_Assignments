Pro:
- A Simple algorithm to implement
- Provides correct results 

Cons:
- Deep recursion, it makes the algorithm extremely inefficient and reqires a large stack for a larger polygon
- Only works for unique colors for multiple opbjects
- Shading is not possible with this algorithm
- Selecting seed position can be difficult for polygons where centre point of the polygon does not fall inside it
