for Phong Shading there is a intense specular highlights in the center and fall off gradually.
To a ray of light , it bounces of the micro-geometry in mirror-like fashion
for the very small no of samples , not much of highlights is seen .

for flat shading ,specular part of the illumination is very nearly constant over the entire facet.

for Gouraud shading , Specular highlights will appear but jumps from vertex to vertex when new line segment is added. 
The specular highlight is quite visisble around the vertex part


the problem is not occuring in the phong shading as it produces highlights which are much less dependent on the underlying polygons 
involving the interpolation of the surface normal and the evaluation of the intensity function for each pixel.
